## Question 1 

We will analyze some data from a famous case of alleged gender discrimination in admission to graduate programs at UC Berkeley in 1973. The three variables are `Admit` (Admitted, Rejected), `Gender` (Male, Female), and `Dept` (Departments A, B, C, D, E, F). First, create a dichotomous outcome variable $y$ that is 1 if Admit=="Admitted" and 0 otherwise.

### 1.1 (2 pts) 

Predict $y$ from `Gender` using a logistic regression. Is the effect significant? Interpret the effect: what is the odds ratio for admission to graduate school for women compared to men? Compute the predicted probability of admission for women and for men.

```{R}
library(tidyverse)
adm <- read_csv("http://www.nathanielwoodward.com/admissions.csv")

# your code here
adm<-adm%>%mutate(y=ifelse(Admit=="Admitted",1,0))
adm

fit<-glm(y~Gender,data=adm,family="binomial")
summary(fit)
exp(coef(fit))

odds2prob <- function(odds){odds/(1+odds)}
#probability for women
odds2prob(0.4358372)
#probability for men 
odds2prob(0.8024112)

```

*The effect is significant because p<0.05. The odds ratio for admission to graduate school for women compared to men is 0.61035. The predicted probability of admission for women is 0.304. The predicted probability of admission for men is 0.445.*

### 1.2 (2 pts) 

Now predict $y$ (admission) from `Dept` using a logistic regression. Interpret the overall pattern of results. For which departments are odds of admission higher than A? Which departments are the most selective? The least?

```{R}
# your code here
fit2<-glm(y~Dept,data=adm,family="binomial")
summary(fit2)
exp(coef(fit2))
```

*The overall results show that all of the departments except for B have a significant effect. None of the other departments have a higher odds of admission than department A. The most selective departments are C,D,E, and F. The least selective are A and B. *

### 1.3 (2 pts) 

Rerun the model from 1.2 but now add `Gender` as a predictor as well. Interpret the coefficient for `Gender` now (note there is no interaction, so the effect doesn't depend on the level of `Dept`). Controlling for Department, is there a significant effect of Gender on admissions? What is the odds ratio? What can you say about departments A and B compared to the others (in terms of odds/probability of admission; relevel if need be)?

```{R}
# your code here
fit3<-glm(y~Dept+Gender,data=adm,family="binomial")
summary(fit3)
exp(coef(fit3))
```

*Controlling for Department, there is not a significant effect of Gender on admissions? The odds ratio for a male in department A compared to a Female in department A is 0.905. The odds of admission for departments A and B are a lot greater than the other departments.*

### 1.4 (2 pts) 

OK, now add the interaction of `Gender` and `Dept` to your model predicting $y$ (admission), to get a fuller picture. Compute the odds ratio for admission (Male vs. Female) in each department (A through F). Which departments favor Male applicants (i.e., higher odds of admission for Males)?

```{R}
# your code here
fit4<-glm(y~Dept*Gender,data=adm,family="binomial")
summary(fit4)
exp(coef(fit4))

```

*Departments C and E favor male applicants.*

### 1.5 (2 pts) 

Take the admit dataset and, using dplyr functions, create a table with counts of applicants of each Gender in each Department (e.g., number of males who applied to department A) and also the percent of applicants admitted of each Gender in each Department. Sort descending by the count variable. In terms of selectivity, what kinds of departments did the majority of women apply to? What about the majority of men? Skim through the wikipedia article about Simpson's paradox (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_paradox) to get a better idea of what is going on here!

## Question 2

Load the `starwars` data (from the dplyr package). Select just the variables `mass`, `height`, and `species` (these three variables only), remove all of the NAs from these, and save the result as `starwars1`.  Create a binary numeric variable $y$, $y=1$ if species is Human, $y=0$ otherwise, and add it as a column in `starwars1` (e.g., using mutate). Use this modified dataset (`starwars1`) for the remaining questions.


## 2.1 (3 pts) 

Predict the dichotomous Human indicator variable (`y`) that you just created from `height` using a logistic regression. Briefly interpret. Plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC (don't worry: it should be terrible). Create a plot of the logistic regression showing predicted probability of being Human by height. Color points by predicted human vs predicted not.

```{R}
# your code here
sw<-starwars %>% filter(!is.na(mass) & !is.na(height), !is.na(species))

starwars1 <- sw %>% select(mass, height, species) %>% mutate(y=ifelse(species=="Human",1,0))

fit5<-glm(y~height,data=starwars1,family="binomial")
summary(fit5)
exp(coef(fit5))

probs<-predict(fit5,type="response")

library(plotROC)
ROCplot<-ggplot(fit5)+geom_roc(aes(d=y,m=probs), n.cuts=0)
ROCplot
calc_auc(ROCplot)

ggplot(fit5, aes(height,y))+
  geom_point(aes(color=y))
```

*For every one unit increase in height, the odds go up by 1.007694.*

## 2.2 (2 pts) 

Predict the Human indicator variable (`y`) from `height` and `mass` (no interaction). Discuss the output briefly (you do not have to interpret any coefficients). Compute Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. Plot the ROC curve and compute the AUC (it should still be bad)

```{R}
# your code here
fit6<-glm(y~height+mass,data=starwars1,family="binomial")
summary(fit6)

probs<-predict(fit6,type="response")
table(predict=as.numeric(probs>0.5),truth=starwars1$y)%>%addmargins

ROCplot<-ggplot(fit6)+geom_roc(aes(d=y,m=probs), n.cuts=0)
ROCplot
calc_auc(ROCplot)

```

*The results of this regression show that nothing is significant.*

## 2.3 (3 pts) 

Predict the Human indicator variable (`y`) from the interaction of height and mass. Be sure to center your variables first, and save them to the `starwars1` dataset as `mass_c` and `height_c`. Discuss the output. Compute Accuracy, Sensitivity, and Specificity. Plot the ROC curve and calculate the AUC. Compare the AUC with that of the main-effects model in 2.2 (it should be a bit better).

```{R}
# your code here

starwars1$mass_c <- (starwars1$mass - mean(starwars1$mass,na.rm=T))
starwars1$height_c <- (starwars1$height - mean(starwars1$height,na.rm=T))

fit7<-glm(y~height_c*mass_c,data=starwars1,family="binomial")
summary(fit7)

probs<-predict(fit7,type="response")
table(predict=as.numeric(probs>0.5),truth=starwars1$y)%>%addmargins

#Accuracy 
(25+6)/58
#Sensitivity 
(6/22)
#Specificity 
(25/36)

ROCplot<-ggplot(starwars1)+geom_roc(aes(d=y,m=probs), n.cuts=0)
ROCplot
calc_auc(ROCplot)

```

*The output shows that only the interaction between height and mass was significant. The AUC is 0.6288 which is higher than in the previous question.*

## 2.4 (2 pts) 

We want to visualize the interaction, but it is continuous! We can get around this by setting mass_c to the mean (0) and plus/minus one standard deviation and then, for each of these three values, looking at the effect of height on the probability of being human. Below, in the code given, I take the dataset and I duplicate it three times: to one, I add a column with `mass_c=0`, to another, I add `mass_c=sd(mass)`, and to the third I add `mass_c=-sd(mass)`. Then, I stack them all on top of each other and add a label variable for each (`mass_cat`). 

Use this new dataset and `predict(your_model_from_2.3, newdata=starwars_new, type="response")` to get predicted probabilities from your interaction model from 2.3, save the predicted probabilities in the dataset starwars_new, and then send this dataset to ggplot to plot those predicted probabilities (y-axis) against height (or height_c, on the x-axis) (use geom_line and set `color=mass_cat`). Interpret the interaction by describing what you see in the plot!

```{R}
## Code to get you started on 2d
starwars_new <- bind_rows(mutate(starwars1,mass_c=0), mutate(starwars1,mass_c=sd(mass)), mutate(starwars1,mass_c=-sd(mass)))

starwars_new <- starwars_new %>%
  mutate(mass_cat=c(rep("mean",nrow(starwars1)), rep("mean+1sd",nrow(starwars1)), rep("mean-1sd",nrow(starwars1))))

# your code here
starwars_new$probabilities <-predict(fit7, newdata=starwars_new, type="response")
starwars_new
ggplot(starwars_new, aes(height,probabilities))+
  geom_line(aes(color=mass_cat))
```

*The effect of height is positive for light characters, but negative for heavy characters.*

R and Python are well-known programming languages that are useful tools to know how to use. In this demonstration I will be showing you how the reticulate package can be used to allow R and Python to talk to each other. 

```{R}
#R code chunk
library(reticulate)
a <- "Thank"
```

```{python}
#Python code chunk
a = "You"
print(r.a,a)
```
